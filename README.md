# Mapped-State-Machine

This C++ data structure is designed to ease the design and implementation of AI state based systems.

It features a nodal based map system with weighted one way links to other states.

These links are initiated based on function weight as well as an attached internal function that allowed for a return value for in depth processing.

## Example usage:

### Initialisation for a map of integer based data:

### Function initialisation

### Node addition and example function running
